# Art Gallery Website - Frontend Challenge

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a static website for an art gallery. It consists of two HTML pages (`project.html` and `secondpage.html`) developed using pure HTML and CSS. The content and images have been sourced from the Art Gallery challenge website.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need:

1. A personal computer (PC).
2. An integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, which you can download from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
3. The Live Server extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
4. To launch the project, click on the "Go Live" button at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code ribbon.

## Project Structure

The project has been organized as follows:

- `project.html`: Represents the first page of the website, divided into header, main (with `main1` and `main2` sections), and footer. CSS properties like Grid, Flexbox, typography, and others have been applied.

- `secondpage.html`: Represents the second page of the website, consisting of a `main` section and a footer.

- `style.css`: Contains CSS styles for both HTML pages. It includes global styles, header styles, main section styles, and footer styles.

## Running the Project

To view the website, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on your PC.
2. Install the Live Server extension if you haven't already.
3. Open the project folder in VS Code.
4. Locate the `project.html` or `secondpage.html` file you want to view.
5. Right-click on the file and select "Open with Live Server."

This will launch the website in your default web browser, allowing you to see the static pages you've created.

Feel free to customize and further develop this project to meet your design and functionality requirements.
