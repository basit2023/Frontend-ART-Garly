# Art Gallery Website - Frontend Challenge
This project involves the creation of a static website consisting of two HTML pages, project.html and secondpage.html, using pure HTML and CSS. The content and images for the website have been sourced from the Art Gallery challenge website.

## Requirements to Run the Project
To run this project, you will need the following:

A personal computer (PC).
An integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, which you can download from here.
The Live Server extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
To launch the project, click on the "Go Live" button at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code ribbon.
Project Structure
The project has been organized into two HTML files, project.html and secondpage.html, and one CSS file named style.css. Below, I'll provide an overview of the project structure and the organization of the HTML files:

project.html
This HTML file represents the first page of the website.
It is divided into three main sections: header, main, and footer.
The main section is further subdivided into main1 and main2, with main1 containing the content for the first section of the website.
In these sections, CSS properties like Grid, Flexbox, typography, and other important styles have been applied to create the layout and design.
secondpage.html
This HTML file represents the second page of the website.
It consists of a main section and a footer.
Unlike the first page, it has a simpler structure with a single main section.
style.css
There is only one CSS file, style.css, which is used for styling both HTML pages.
In this CSS file, you will find styles that are common to both pages, including global styles, header styles, main section styles, and footer styles.
Specific styles for individual sections, pages, or elements have also been defined in this file.
Running the Project
To view the website, follow these steps:

Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on your PC.
Install the Live Server extension if you haven't already.
Open the project folder in VS Code.
Locate the project.html or secondpage.html file you want to view.
Right-click on the file and select "Open with Live Server."
This will launch the website in your default web browser, allowing you to see the static pages you've created.

Feel free to customize and further develop this project to meet your design and functionality requirements. If you have any specific questions or need assistance with any aspect of the project, please don't hesitate to ask. Enjoy working on your Art Gallery website!
